This is my attempt at The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors project. At the first attempt, we are to use no CSS or HTML to make the page look presentable. The Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) game is all done through the console. This is what my first iteration does, which was completed May 31st 2022 at 2:40pm est.


The date is no June 28th 2022 at 4:29pm est, and I just finished revisiting Rock Paper Scissors. The goal with this revisiting was to create a user interface that would allow the user to start the game at his/her own will, and select buttons instead of typing in their choice for RPS. This UI would also include a score tracker, results display, and declare the winner after 5 rounds have been played. Overrall I'm very happy with how this project turned out. I got a much better understanding of DOM events than before I started and I am excited to use them in the future. I will say my CSS and overally design of the webpage could use some work, and I struggled a bit with Flexbox again. However, I enjoyed the process when it came to overcomming my difficulties.
